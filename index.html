        </h3>
        <p>
          On opposite sides of a quiet street lived two friends. From morning to
          evening, they played. ‘‘You two are stuck together like glue!’’ their
          parents and teachers laughed. So it was a shock when, one day, they
          had to stop and go inside. Between them now was only space. Suddenly,
          outside was scary and felt very large. Their parents were full of
          whispers and frowns and the worry inside felt heavy. Where can you put
          friendship when friends are apart? Slowly, they learned. They found
          that, across the street and through windows, they could give each
          other a hug. They discovered that a smile is a hug. A wave is a hug.
          And funny faces, a phone call, a song. They discovered that when
          you’re apart a friendship doesn’t leave. With time and effort it will
          grow and grow, until it is big, bigger than all fears. Inspired by
          real-world events, The Big Hug is a story of love’s resilience.

            Franny's Father is a Feminist
          </a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Franny’s Father is a Feminist. It’s simple, really! He knows that
          girls can do anything boys can do, and raises Franny to believe that
          she deserves all the same rights, freedoms, and opportunities to
          fulfill her dreams that he had. Through sweet, straight-forward prose,
          Franny’s Father portrays the loving bond between a young girl, and her
          father who isn’t afraid of bucking gender norms in order to ensure
          that his daughter grows up smart, strong, and full of self confidence.
          From teaching her to fix her own bicycle and splashing in the mud, to
          cheering at ballet recitals and supporting Franny’s mother in her
          career, Franny’s Father displays what it means for a man to be a
          Feminist, and how male Feminism can play a vital role in the
          empowerment of young women.
